# Bitcoin-API
This API was made to show Bitcoin data from CoinGecko. In the application there is three different search fields where you can view the data. On the first field you can search for the longest bearish downward trend within a given date range. On the second field you can search where a given date range had the highest trading volume, and in the last search field you can search when you should buy, and when you should sell if you had access to a time machine.

You can use the app by opening the index.html file in your browser.

The app was made with JavaScript, HTML and CSS.
